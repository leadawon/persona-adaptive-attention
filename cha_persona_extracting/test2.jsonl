How is that?", "Speaker 2: It was fun when it involved marketing for her books. However, I do not want to help her build her image. I hate her views, so it would be like torture for me.", "Speaker 1: Oh I totally get that, that didn't affect you at all when doing your marketing?", "Speaker 2: No, not at all. Hey, did your doctor say there were any side effects to that new allergy medication? I've been trying to be more conscious of how everything I put into my body affects me lately.
